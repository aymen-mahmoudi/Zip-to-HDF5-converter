# Zip (SES) to HDF5 3D matrix converter


## Description
This project enables the conversion of zip files from the Scienta-Omicron SES program into HDF5 format, significantly enhancing compatibility with a wider range of software and IGOR macros. The zip format is processed using the navarp library developed by Federico Bisti (https://gitlab.com/fbisti/navarp), with a straightforward extraction process facilitated by an intuitive GUI included in the project.

The GUI enable also to save the experimeent relative infos into a txt file.

## Usage
The easiest way is to use the exe file from the bin folder (under W64). Otherwise, you can run the main file to launch the GUI (I recommend to setup a python 3.8 virtual environment).
